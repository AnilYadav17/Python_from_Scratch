# 🔤 Topic 1: Strings (Days 25-30)
### Core Concepts
* **Immutability**: Strings cannot be modified in-place. All transformations return new strings.
* **Basic Methods**: `split()`, `join()`, `isdigit()`, `isalpha()`, `isalnum()`, `startswith()`, `endswith()`.
* **Custom Implementations**: Often, tests forbid using `title()`, `reverse()`, or `Counter`. You must write manual logic.

### 🌟 Key Patterns to Remember
* **Manual Title Case (No `.title()`)**:
  ```python
  words = s.split()
  formatted = [w[0].upper() + w[1:] for w in words]
  result = " ".join(formatted)
  ```
* **Masking Strings (e.g., Bank Cards)**:
  ```python
  masked = "*" * (len(card) - 4) + card[-4:]
  ```
* **Run-length Expansion (`a3b2` -> `aaabb`)**:
  ```python
  expanded = ""
  for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
      char = s[i]
      count = int(s[i+1])
      expanded += char * count
  ```

# 📋 Topic 2: Lists & Nested Lists (Days 31-36)
### Core Concepts
* **Peak Element**: An element which is greater than or equal to its neighbors.
  * For edge elements, compare with the single neighbor:
  ```python
  if i == 0: is_peak = arr[0] >= arr[1]
  elif i == n - 1: is_peak = arr[-1] >= arr[-2]
  else: is_peak = arr[i] >= arr[i-1] and arr[i] >= arr[i+1]
  ```
* **Leader in Array**: An element greater than all elements to its right.
  * Traverse from right to left to solve in $O(N)$ time:
  ```python
  max_so_far = float('-inf')
  leaders = []
  for num in reversed(arr):
      if num > max_so_far:
          leaders.append(num)
          max_so_far = num
  leaders.reverse()
  ```
* **List Comprehensions**:
  * Syntax: `[expr for item in list if condition]`
  * Bonus Application: `[sal + 5000 if sal < 30000 else sal for sal in salaries]`

<!-- slide -->
# 🧬 Topic 3: Tuples & NamedTuples (Day 37)
### Core Concepts
* **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections. Defined by `(item1, item2, ...)`. Used when records should not change.
* **NamedTuple**: Part of `collections` module. It combines tuple immutability with named attribute access.
  ```python
  from collections import namedtuple
  Employee = namedtuple('Employee', ['emp_id', 'emp_name', 'department', 'salary'])
  ```

### 🌟 Key Patterns
* **Reading List of NamedTuples**:
  ```python
  employees = []
  for _ in range(n):
      eid, name, dept, sal = input().split()
      employees.append(Employee(int(eid), name, dept, float(sal)))
  ```
* **Finding Max by attribute**:
  ```python
  highest_sal_emp = max(employees, key=lambda emp: emp.salary)
  ```

<!-- slide -->
# 🕸️ Topic 4: Sets & Frozensets (Day 38)
### Core Concepts
* **Set**: Unordered collection of unique items. Mutable, but items must be hashable.
* **Frozenset**: Immutable version of set. Can be used as a dictionary key or placed inside another set.
* **Set Operations**:
  * **Union (`|` / `union()`)**: All unique members across sets.
  * **Intersection (`&` / `intersection()`)**: Members in both sets.
  * **Difference (`-` / `difference()`)**: Members in first set but not the second.
  * **Symmetric Difference (`^`)**: Members in either set, but not both.

### 🌟 How to Nest Sets
Since sets are mutable, you *cannot* have a set of sets (`{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}` raises `TypeError`). You must nest using `frozenset`:
```python
nested_set = {frozenset({1, 2}), frozenset({3, 4})}
```

<!-- slide -->
# 📖 Topic 5: Dictionaries & Nested Dicts (Day 39)
### Core Concepts
* **Dict**: Key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and hashable.
* **Nested Dictionary**: Values themselves are dictionaries. Great for structured databases.
  ```python
  db = {
      "emp1": {"name": "Ajay", "dept": "IT", "salary": 50000},
      "emp2": {"name": "Priya", "dept": "HR", "salary": 45000}
  }
  ```

### 🌟 Key Patterns
* **Frequency Counting without `Counter`**:
  ```python
  freq = {}
  for item in items:
      freq[item] = freq.get(item, 0) + 1
  ```
* **Grouping by length (Dict of Lists)**:
  ```python
  grouped = {}
  for word in words:
      l = len(word)
      grouped.setdefault(l, []).append(word)
  ```

<!-- slide -->
# 🧊 Topic 6: 3D Matrices (Days 34-35)
### Core Concepts
* A 3D Matrix is a list of lists of lists. It represents dimensions: `Depth x Rows x Columns` (or `Blocks x Rows x Cols`).
* **Initialization** (e.g., $2 \times 3 \times 4$ filled with 0s):
  ```python
  matrix_3d = [[[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)] for _ in range(depth)]
  ```
* **Traversing a 3D Matrix**:
  ```python
  for d in range(depth):
      for r in range(rows):
          for c in range(cols):
              print(matrix_3d[d][r][c])
  ```

### 🌟 Aggregate Computations
* **Sum of all elements**:
  ```python
  total_sum = sum(matrix_3d[d][r][c] for d in range(depth) for r in range(rows) for c in range(cols))
  ```
* **Plane-wise (Depth-wise) Sum**:
  ```python
  plane_sums = [sum(sum(row) for row in plane) for plane in matrix_3d]
  ```

## 🎯 Solved Exam Practice Questions (One-by-One Review)

### 🔤 Section 1: Strings
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Question 1**: Read an alphanumeric string from the user. Clean the string by removing all special characters (keep only letters, digits, and spaces). Then, reverse each word individually, but keep the word positions unchanged. First letter of each reversed word should be capitalized.
>
> *Input:* `Pyth@n!! is ve#ry ea$sy`  
> *Output:* `Nohtyp Si Yrev Ysae`

#### Implementation Strategy
1. Remove all characters that are not `.isalnum()` or space.
2. Split the cleaned string into words.
3. For each word, reverse it (`word[::-1]`), lowercase the rest, and capitalize the first character (`.capitalize()`).
4. Join the words back with spaces.

```python
def process_string(s):
    # Step 1: Clean special characters
    cleaned_chars = [char for char in s if char.isalnum() or char.isspace()]
    cleaned_str = "".join(cleaned_chars)
    
    # Step 2: Split and transform
    words = cleaned_str.split()
    transformed_words = []
    
    for word in words:
        reversed_word = word[::-1]
        # Capitalize only first letter, keep others lowercase
        transformed_words.append(reversed_word.capitalize())
        
    return " ".join(transformed_words)

# Example execution
user_input = "Pyth@n!! is ve#ry ea$sy"
print(process_string(user_input)) # Output: Nohtyp Si Yrev Ysae
```

### 📋 Section 2: Lists & Nested Lists
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Question 2**: You are given an array of elevation points of a hiker. Find all "peak" checkpoints (which are greater than or equal to their neighbors). Also, write a list comprehension to filter out hikers with speed below average and award a speed bonus of 10% to the remaining hikers.
>
> *Input:* `elevations = [100, 200, 150, 180, 170]`, `speeds = [12, 15, 9, 20, 14]`  
> *Output:* Peaks = `[200, 180]`, Updated Speeds = `[16.5, 22.0, 15.4]` (since average speed is 14)

#### Implementation Strategy
1. Loop through list, checking boundaries.
2. For list comprehension, calculate average first, then apply conditional operation.

```python
def find_peaks_and_boost(elevations, speeds):
    n = len(elevations)
    peaks = []
    
    # Peak detection logic
    for i in range(n):
        if n == 1:
            peaks.append(elevations[0])
        elif i == 0:
            if elevations[0] >= elevations[1]:
                peaks.append(elevations[0])
        elif i == n - 1:
            if elevations[n-1] >= elevations[n-2]:
                peaks.append(elevations[n-1])
        else:
            if elevations[i] >= elevations[i-1] and elevations[i] >= elevations[i+1]:
                peaks.append(elevations[i])
                
    # List comprehension speed boost
    avg_speed = sum(speeds) / len(speeds)
    # Give 10% boost to those with speed >= average speed
    boosted_speeds = [s * 1.1 for s in speeds if s >= avg_speed]
    
    return peaks, boosted_speeds

elevations = [100, 200, 150, 180, 170]
speeds = [12, 15, 9, 20, 14]
p, s = find_peaks_and_boost(elevations, speeds)
print("Peaks:", p)            # Peaks: [200, 180]
print("Boosted Speeds:", [round(val, 2) for val in s]) # Boosted Speeds: [16.5, 22.0, 15.4]
```

### 🧬 Section 3: Tuples & NamedTuples
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Question 3**: Define a `Student` NamedTuple with fields `roll_no`, `name`, `course`, and `marks`. Read details of $N$ students, store them, find the topper, and display the average marks of the class.
>
> *Input:*  
> `3`  
> `1 Ajay Python 85`  
> `2 Priya Java 90`  
> `3 Neha Python 95`  
>  
> *Output:*  
> Topper: `3 Neha Python 95`  
> Average Marks: `90.0`

```python
from collections import namedtuple

# Define NamedTuple
Student = namedtuple('Student', ['roll_no', 'name', 'course', 'marks'])

def run_student_tracker():
    students = []
    # Hardcoded input simulation
    inputs = [
        "1 Ajay Python 85",
        "2 Priya Java 90",
        "3 Neha Python 95"
    ]
    
    for record in inputs:
        roll, name, course, marks = record.split()
        students.append(Student(int(roll), name, course, float(marks)))
        
    # Find topper
    topper = max(students, key=lambda s: s.marks)
    
    # Calculate average
    avg_marks = sum(s.marks for s in students) / len(students)
    
    print(f"Topper: {topper.roll_no} {topper.name} {topper.course} {topper.marks}")
    print(f"Average Marks: {avg_marks}")

run_student_tracker()
```

### 🕸️ Section 4: Sets & Frozensets (with Nesting)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Question 4**: A college maintains sets of student IDs in `Coding_Club` and `Robotics_Club`. Find students in both clubs, students unique to coding, and total unique students across both. Also, create a nested set of frozen sets representing groups of students.
>
> *Input:*  
> `coding = {101, 102, 103, 104}`  
> `robotics = {103, 104, 105, 106}`  
>  
> *Output:*  
> Both: `{103, 104}`  
> Only Coding: `{101, 102}`  
> Total Unique: `{101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106}`

```python
def set_operations_demo():
    coding = {101, 102, 103, 104}
    robotics = {103, 104, 105, 106}
    
    # 1. Intersection (Both clubs)
    both = coding & robotics # or coding.intersection(robotics)
    
    # 2. Difference (Only Coding)
    only_coding = coding - robotics # or coding.difference(robotics)
    
    # 3. Union (All Unique Members)
    all_unique = coding | robotics # or coding.union(robotics)
    
    # 4. Nested sets (Must use frozenset for nesting!)
    # We want a set containing the groups
    group1 = frozenset(coding)
    group2 = frozenset(robotics)
    nested_set = {group1, group2}
    
    print("Both Clubs:", both)
    print("Only Coding:", only_coding)
    print("All Unique Members:", all_unique)
    print("Nested Set of Frozensets:", nested_set)

### 🧊 Section 6: 3D Matrices
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Question 6**: Initialize a 3D Matrix of size $D \times R \times C$ (Depth, Rows, Columns) with user inputs. Perform the following operations:
> 1. Print the 3D Matrix plane-by-plane.
> 2. Find the global maximum element and its 3D coordinate index `(depth, row, col)`.

> `7 8 9`  
> `10 11 12`

```python
def run_3d_matrix_analysis():
    # Size dimensions
    depth, rows, cols = 2, 2, 3
    
    # Input simulation: Flat list of values to fill in

## 💡 Top 5 Tips for the Test
1. **Never use prohibited built-ins**: If the question says "Do not use `title()`", write the capitalize splits manually. If it says "Do not use `Counter`", use the `.get(key, 0)` dictionary pattern.
2. **Handle array edge cases**: When analyzing neighbors (like peak check or leader check), always check bounds first so your code doesn't crash with `IndexError`.
3. **Use Frozenset for nesting sets**: Normal sets cannot contain sets. Use `frozenset` when you need to group items inside an outer set.
4. **Be comfortable with list comprehensions**: Expect questions asking you to write a single-line list comprehension containing conditionals (e.g. `[x for x in list if condition]`).
5. **Remember 3D coordinates**: For 3D matrices, index order is always `[depth][row][col]`. When writing triple loops, keep this order to iterate correctly.

Good luck! 🚀
